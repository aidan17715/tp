Adds a new item to the list of todo items.

Format: `todo n/TODO_NAME d/DEADLINE`

* The `DEADLINE` can be in a natural language format.
* The `TODO_NAME` cannot contain punctuation.

Example of usage:

`todo n/Write the rest of the User Guide d/next week`

### Recommending recipes: `recommend-r`

The `recommend-r` command has two modes:

- **Ingredient-based** — finds recipes that use a specific ingredient you already have enough of.
- **Inventory-based** — finds every recipe that can be fully made using your current inventory.

---

#### Ingredient-based recommendation

Shows all recipes that contain a specific ingredient, provided your inventory holds at least the required quantity.

Format: `recommend-r n/INGREDIENT_NAME`

* `INGREDIENT_NAME` is case-insensitive (`egg`, `Egg`, and `EGG` all work).
* The ingredient must exist in your inventory; otherwise an error is shown.
* Only recipes whose required quantity of the ingredient is **≤** the amount you have are listed.

Examples:

`recommend-r n/egg`

`recommend-r n/Sugar`

Expected output (ingredient found, matching recipes exist):
```
Recipes containing egg:
1. Omelette
2. Fried Rice
```

Expected output (ingredient not in inventory):
```
Oops! Ingredient "beef" does not exist in inventory.
```

Expected output (ingredient in inventory but no recipe uses enough of it):
```
No recipes meet the requirement
```

---

#### Inventory-based recommendation

Shows all recipes that can be fully made with your current inventory — every required ingredient must be present in sufficient quantity.

Format: `recommend-r`

* A recipe is only listed if **all** of its ingredients are available in the inventory with enough quantity.
* Ingredient name matching is case-insensitive.

Example:

`recommend-r`

Expected output (some recipes are makeable):
```
Recipes you can make with your inventory:
1. Omelette
2. Mixue
```

Expected output (no recipe can be fully made):
```
No recipes can be made with the current inventory.
```
